Where Use "while" Loop
     The while loop is used to repeat a section of code an unknown number of times until a specific condition is met.
     For example, say we want to know how many times a given number can be divided by 2 before it is less than or equal to 1.
     
     
Where Use "for" Loop
      A "For" Loop is used to repeat a specific block of code a known number of times.
      For example, if we want to check the grade of every student in the class, we loop from 1 to that number. 
      When the number of times is not known before hand, we use a "While" loop.
